# Applied Data Science Capstone Project

This is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate as well as the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization.

The final assignment involves assuming the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and following the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting results to stakeholders.

The following tasks have been performed:

- [Data Collection and Cleaning from SpaceX API](1_data_collection_api.ipynb)
- [Web Scraping Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy Launch Records from Wikipedia](2_web_scraping.ipynb)
- [Data Exploration, Wrangling, and Analysis](3_data_wrangling.ipynb)
- [Database Population and Exploration](4_eda_sql_coursera_sqllite.ipynb)
- [Data Visualization and Preparation for Feature Engineering](5_eda_dataviz.ipynb)
- [Analysis of Launch Site Locations with Folium](6_launch_site_location.ipynb)
- [Creation of an Interactive Dashboard for Launch Record Analysis](7_dash_app.py)
- [Training, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Comparison, and Prediction of SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Success](8_machine_learning_prediction.ipynb)

*An overview of the methodologies used, the results obtained, and the conclusions drawn can be found in the [***report***](ds_capstone.pdf)*.
